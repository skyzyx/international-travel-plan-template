As a culture, we have a tendency to be a bit self-involved, and not react well when other places are not like home.</p> <p>As an American traveling abroad, I\u2019ve been asked by people from other cultures and countries: Why?</p> <p>In short, the USA is a big place, and North America is surprisingly homogenous compared to other parts of the world. Many Americans never leave the USA because it\u2019s so big that they don\u2019t need to. Sometimes, however, the result is that we never have to think about different power plugs, currencies, cultures, languages, or more than a few hours of time zones.</p> <p>English is by far the dominant language, with Spanish coming in second, and French in third across North America. Several telecommunications companies have North America plans with calling and data while traveling to Canada and Mexico. It\u2019s quite different from Europe, where each country can have multiple official languages.</p> <p>However, some American travelers are just under-informed. Most public schools teach from a very US-centric perspective, and if people don\u2019t leave the country (again because they don\u2019t need to), they have no way of learning.
