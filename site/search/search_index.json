I Intersex An umbrella term to capture various types of biological sex differentiation. Intersex people have variations in their sex characteristics, such as sex chromosomes, internal reproductive organs, genitalia, and/or secondary sex characteristics (e.g., muscle mass, breasts) that fall outside of what is typically categorized as male or female. A Asexual/Aromantic An aromantic person lacks romantic attraction or interest in romantic expression. An asexual person lacks sexual attraction or interest in sexual expression.
