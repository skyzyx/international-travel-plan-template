# Preface

Hi! 👋🏻 My name is Ryan!

As an American 🇺🇸 with family living in Canada 🇨🇦, I've done a lot of traveling between the two countries. More recently, I’ve started traveling inter-continentally on vacation.

Over the years, I've put together a template that allows me to keep track of what’s important for travel. However, when I started with inter-continental travel, I’ve had to dramatically expand my template. The more countries I visit, and the more people I travel with, the more I’ve needed to explain things both to my future self as well as my travel partners.

This is a collection of tips, tricks, products, and patterns that I use to make travel planning easy. I’ve also collected tips from friends and co-workers to pull-together the most relevant information for prospective travelers coming from the USA.  🇺🇸

My hope is that this will help you plan your own trips, and make international travel feel more accessible.

While my template has evolved over the years, and will likely continue to evolve as I experience traveling to more places, I want to say thanks 🙏🏻 to [37signals](https://37signals.com) and their [Backpack](https://basecamp.com/handbook/05-product-histories#backpack) 🎒 product which inspired me to create the first version of this template back in the mid-2000s.
