For thousands of years, people have created and sold things of value in exchange for money. That is, _until the internet_.

    We have created this collection of guides in the hope that it provides value to you, dear reader. We don’t like abusive advertising, data tracking, and other things that websites do to make money while giving you stuff “for free”. So we intentionally do not make money that way.

    In exchange, we ask for your direct support. Without your support, we won't be able to continue creating/maintaining things like this. If you can’t support us financially, we ask that you help us grow our audience by sharing our links and YouTube videos.
