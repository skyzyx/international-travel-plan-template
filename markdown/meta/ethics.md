# Ethics and integrity statement

## Statement of autonomy

Our guides remain uninfluenced by external sources or financial considerations. The products we reference are because we use and/or believe in them, and never because someone paid for placement — unless it is clearly labeled as such.

## Clearly labels advertising

The site makes clear which content is paid for and which is not.

## Reveals who’s in charge, including possible conflicts of interest

Those in charge of the content are identified on the site, and there is a way for readers to contact the site about editorial issues. In other words, the reader is told who is in charge of deciding what content is published.

## The site provides the names of content creators, along with contact information

Information about those producing the content is made accessible on the site, and it is generally clear who produces which content.

## Data tracking

We aim to be respectful of our readers, and limit data tracking to only what is directly relevant. You can learn more in our [privacy policy](privacy.md).
