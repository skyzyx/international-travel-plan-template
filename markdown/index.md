# Hi! 👋🏻 We’re Jessika and Ryan!

We’re Americans 🇺🇸 with close family living in Canada 🇨🇦. We’ve done a lot of traveling between the two countries. More recently, we’ve started traveling inter-continentally on vacation.

Over the years, Ryan has put together a template[^1] that allows us to keep track of what’s important for travel. However, when we started traveling inter-continentally, we had to dramatically expand the template. The more countries we visit, and the more people we travel with, the more we’ve needed to explain things both to our future selves as well as our travel partners.

This is a collection of tips, tricks, products, and patterns that we use to make travel planning easy flying out of the USA 🇺🇸 and Canada 🇨🇦.

    While our template has evolved over the years, and will continue to evolve as we experience traveling to more places, Ryan wanted to say thanks 🙏🏻 to [37signals](https://37signals.com) and their [Backpack](https://basecamp.com/handbook/05-product-histories#backpack) 🎒 product which inspired him to create the first version of this template back in the mid-2000s.
