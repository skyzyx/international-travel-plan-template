# Technology tips

I call this chapter "Technology tips" because they are broad patterns, habits, and guidelines that will apply to the majority of your trips with regard to technology.

## üì± Modern travel requires a modern cell phone

While some will nitpick this, I‚Äôm going to boldly claim that _modern travel requires a modern cell phone_. Or, at the very least, makes it dramatically simpler than if you don‚Äôt.

If you‚Äôre still hanging onto your old flip phone, or if you have a smart phone more than 4 years old, or if you just use your smart phone as a regular telephone (hi mom!), then you are ill-prepared for modern international travel.

This guide assumes that you:

* Have a smartphone‚Ä¶
* ‚Ä¶with Apple‚Äôs iOS or Google‚Äôs Android OS‚Ä¶
* ‚Ä¶that is no more than 4-ish years old‚Ä¶
* ‚Ä¶and you know how to use your phone for more than texting and phone calls.

It also assumes that you don‚Äôt have a fear of modern technology.

* You use biometric unlock (e.g., fingerprint, face).
* You leverage your phone‚Äôs _Wallet_ app for IDs and passes.
* You know how to use Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay, et al.
* You know how to install and use apps for your phone.

## üß† Avoid mental traps

Avoid trapping travel information inside of your brain. Make an effort to get it out of your brain and into a shared format that _all travel companions_ can use. This can also help you avoid forgetting some important detail.

## üõú Syncing

If traveling with other people, have some way to sync travel information and changes to everyone's device.

On iPhones, [_Apple Notes_][apple-notes-sharing] can be a good option because it‚Äôs free, it comes with the phone by default, and is simple to use.

On Android phones, @TODO can be a good option because @TODO.

## üìÇ Sharing files

If anything is a file ‚Äî confirmation emails saved as PDFs, event tickets as PDFs, etc. ‚Äî using a file syncing app can help ensure that all travelers have access to the same information. This can be useful if someone gets sick, or is late getting back from sight-seeing, or other situations where having access to that information could be helpful.

On iPhones, creating a [shared _iCloud Drive_ folder] is a simple and straightforward solution. All iPhones come with the Files app, and sharing an iCloud Drive folder is easy.

On Android phones, creating a [shared _Google Drive_ folder] is often a simple and straightforward solution (assuming your Android phone comes with Google-branded apps).

[Dropbox], [OneDrive], [Google Drive], [Evernote], and other solutions may work just as well. Make sure that all travelers can use the same thing.

## üì∫ Netflix and chill

If you‚Äôre traveling long distances to a multi-hour jump from your home timezone, it definitely makes sense to schedule some _chill time_. Maybe stream something to watch.

Because of the way that media rights work, the content selection will be different in different countries, even with your home login information.

| Services                                | Availability                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Netflix], [Apple TV+]                  | Are available for streaming in the most countries around the world.                  |
| [Amazon Prime Video], [Disney+], [St‚òÖr] | Are available in most countries throughout North America, Europe, and parts of Asia. |
| [HBO Max]                               | Available in a handful of countries.                                                 |
| [Hulu]                                  | US-only.                                                                             |

Alternatively, you can temporarily _download_ from these services from the USA/Canada before you leave. If you want to watch that content on a full-size television, you should bring an [HDMI cable] and an adapter for your phone's connector.

For iPhones and iPads, Apple offers the [Lightning Digital AV Adapter] and the [USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter], although you can find quality, reliable alternatives from companies like Belkin, Mophie, and others.

For Android devices, @TODO.

## üìç Maps and guides

In mapping apps, you can create and share _guides_, which is a collection of locations. I like to take every address/location we expect to visit on the trip, add them to a guide, and share the guide with my fellow travelers. It makes it easy for any person to find important places on the trip.

This feature is available in both [_Apple Maps_][apple-maps-sharing] and [_Google Maps_][google-maps-sharing], and potentially others. Check your preferred mapping app for this functionality.

## üì∑ Photo sharing

Most phones support _shared photo albums_. Create the album, invite your fellow travelers, and each person can take photos and add them to the shared album.

You can do this in both [_Apple Photos_][apple-photo-sharing] and [_Google Photos_][google-photo-sharing], and potentially others. Check your preferred photo management app for this functionality.

## ‚úàÔ∏è Travel apps

Apps that keep track of flight/travel details can be useful. [Trip It], [Kayak], and apps like [Flighty] can be helpful, and will even send you push notifications about your flights. Most require a subscription for real-time data access and updates. Even if you don‚Äôt like app subscriptions, subscribing for the month of your trip could be worthwhile.

## üì≤ Apps to install
