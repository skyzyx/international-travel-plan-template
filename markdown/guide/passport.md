# Passport

In order to travel internationally, you’ll need a passport. Make sure you give yourself **plenty** of time to get through the process and receive your physical passport in-hand.

    !!! important

        Worst-case scenario, it will take about **4½ months** (start-to-finish) to receive your physical passport in-hand. This is [13 weeks for processing](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/processing-times.html) + 2 weeks to mail paperwork + 2 weeks to mail passport. The more time you give yourself, the cheaper and less stressful it is.
