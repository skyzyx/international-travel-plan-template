# Advice for 2SLGBTQIA+ Travelers

## :material-gender-transgender: What is 2SLGBTQIA+?

(_Text taken from [2SLGBTQI+ terminology – Glossary and common acronyms](https://women-gender-equality.canada.ca/en/free-to-be-me/2slgbtqi-plus-glossary.html)._)

2SLGBTQI+ terminology is continuously evolving. As a result, it is important to note that this list is not exhaustive and these definitions are a starting point to understanding 2SLGBTQI+ identities and issues. Different 2SLGBTQI+ individuals and communities may have broader or more specific understandings of these terms.

The Canadian government uses _2SLGBTQI+_ as its term for this community. The U.S. government uses _LGBTQI+_ as its term for this community. Some people might have heard/read the terms _LGBTQIA+_, _LGBTQ2_, _LGBTQIA+_, _LGBTI_, or _LGBT_.

!!! note "Author’s Note"

    While we have friends, family, and people who are important to us who are part of these communities, some of this is still very new to us. **We’re still learning.** If we can do better, please [let us know](https://github.com/skyzyx/international-travel-planning-guide/issues).
