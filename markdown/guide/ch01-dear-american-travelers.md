# Dear American travelers

American travelers can have a poor reputation when traveling abroad. As a culture, we have a tendency to be a bit self-involved, and not react well when other places are not like home.

As an American traveling abroad, I’ve been asked by people from other cultures and countries: _Why?_

In short, the USA is a big place, and North America is surprisingly homogenous compared to other parts of the world. Many Americans never leave the USA because it’s so big that _they don’t need to_. Sometimes, however, the result is that we never have to think about different power plugs, currencies, cultures, languages, or more than a few hours of time zones.

English is by far the dominant language, with Spanish coming in second, and French in third across North America. Several telecommunications companies have _North America_ plans with calling and data while traveling to Canada and Mexico. It’s quite different from Europe, where each country can have _multiple_ official languages.

However, _some_ American travelers are just under-informed. Most public schools teach from a very US-centric perspective, and if people don’t leave the country (again because they don’t need to), they have no way of learning. Here are some things that are not always obvious to new American travelers.

## Things to know

* When you are in a different country, **YOU** are the “foreigner”. The word “foreigner” DOES NOT mean “not American”, despite what you may have been lead to believe. It just means someone who is here from a different country. When an American travels to a different country, the American becomes the foreigner.

* Honor the customs of that country, instead of trying to make them bend to what you’re used to. Be a _student_, and learn about how they do things in their country.

* Not every country speaks English. Learn [how to pronounce some key phrases in the language used in that country](https://translate.google.com). While some countries speak English as a _second_ or _third_ language, take the time to learn the language of the place you’re visiting.

* While there are some exceptions to this rule, don’t expect people in other countries to accept U.S. dollars. They often have [their own money for their own country](https://currency.world/exchange_rates/all), and it’s not usually 1:1 the same value as U.S. dollars. For example, $1 US is not (usually) worth $1 Canadian.

    If you don’t understand different currencies, exchange rates, and how they change regularly, go to your local bank and ask them to explain it to you.

* Tipping culture is different in different countries. Learn about tipping culture for where you’re visiting before you go. Most places have lower tipping standards compared to the USA. Some countries don’t tip at all. Don’t expect it to be the same as in the USA.

* Sales tax is calculated differently in different countries. Learn about sales tax for where you’re visiting before you go. Don’t be surprised when it’s different from the USA.
