# Technology Tips

These are broad patterns, habits, and guidelines that will apply to the majority of your trips with regard to technology.

## :material-cellphone: Modern travel requires a modern cell phone

While some will nitpick this, I’m going to boldly claim that _modern travel requires a modern cell phone_. Or, at the very least, makes it dramatically simpler than if you don’t.

If you’re still hanging onto your old flip phone, or if you have a smart phone more than 4 years old, or if you just use your smart phone as a regular telephone (hi mom!), then you are ill-prepared for modern international travel.

This guide assumes that you:

* Have a smartphone…
* …with Apple’s iOS or Google’s Android OS…
* …that is no more than 4-ish years old…
* …you know how to use your phone for more than texting and phone calls…
* …and you know how to install and use apps for your phone.

## :brain: Avoid mental traps

Avoid trapping travel information inside of your brain. Make an effort to get it out of your brain and into a shared format that _all travel companions_ can use. This can also help you avoid forgetting some important detail.

## :material-sync-circle:{ .google-blue } Syncing

If traveling with other people, have some way to sync travel information and changes to everyone's device.

|                            Platform                             | Suggestion                                                                                                                           |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|          :simple-ios:{ .lg .middle title="Apple iOS" }          | [Apple Notes][apple-notes-sharing] can be a good option because it’s free, it comes with the phone by default, and is simple to use. |
| :simple-android:{ .lg .middle .android title="Google Android" } | @TODO can be a good option because @TODO.                                                                                            |

## :material-file-sync-outline: Sharing files

If anything is a file — confirmation emails saved as PDFs, event tickets as PDFs, etc. — using a file syncing app can help ensure that all travelers have access to the same information. This can be useful if someone gets sick, or is late getting back from sight-seeing, or other situations where having access to that information could be helpful.

|                 Platform                  | Suggestion                                                                                                                                                         |
|:-----------------------------------------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   {% include 'partials/table-ios.md' %}   | Creating a [shared iCloud Drive folder] is a simple and straightforward solution. All iPhones come with the Files app, and sharing an iCloud Drive folder is easy. |
| {% include 'partials/table-android.md' %} | Creating a [shared Google Drive folder] is often a simple and straightforward solution (assuming your Android phone comes with Google-branded apps).               |

Other solutions may work just as well. Make sure that all travelers can use the same thing. Here are some paid options:

* :simple-dropbox:{ .dropbox } [Dropbox]
* :simple-evernote:{ .evernote } [Evernote]
* :simple-googledrive:{ .google-blue } [Google Drive]
* :simple-microsoftonedrive:{ .ms-onedrive } [Microsoft OneDrive][OneDrive]
* :simple-microsoftonenote:{ .ms-onenote } [Microsoft OneNote][OneNote]

## :simple-netflix:{ .netflix } Netflix and chill

If you’re traveling long distances to a multi-hour jump from your home timezone, it definitely makes sense to schedule some _chill time_. Maybe stream something to watch.

Because of the way that media rights work, the content selection will be different in different countries, even with your home login information.

| Services                                | Availability                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Netflix], [Apple TV+]                  | Are available for streaming in the most countries around the world.                  |
| [Amazon Prime Video], [Disney+], [St★r] | Are available in most countries throughout North America, Europe, and parts of Asia. |
| [HBO Max]                               | Available in a handful of countries.                                                 |
| [Hulu]                                  | US-only.                                                                             |

Alternatively, you can temporarily _download_ from these services from the USA/Canada before you leave. If you want to watch that content on a full-size television, you should bring an [HDMI cable] and an adapter for your phone's connector.

|                     Vendor                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|:-----------------------------------------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   :simple-apple:{ .lg .middle title="Apple" }   | Apple offers the [Lightning Digital AV Adapter] and the [USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter], although you can find quality, reliable alternatives from companies like Belkin, Mophie, and others. |
|  :simple-google:{ .lg .middle title="Google" }  | Google offers the [Moshi USB-C to HDMI Adapter] for Google Pixel devices.                                                                                                                          |
| :simple-samsung:{ .lg .middle title="Samsung" } | Samsung offers the [Samsung USB-C to HDMI Adapter] for Samsung devices.                                                                                                                            |

## :material-map-marker:{ .netflix } Maps and guides

In mapping apps, you can create and share _guides_, which is a collection of locations. I like to take every address/location we expect to visit on the trip, add them to a guide, and share the guide with my fellow travelers. It makes it easy for any person to find important places on the trip.

This feature is available in both :fontawesome-solid-map-pin:{ .middle .apple-music } [Apple Maps][apple-maps-sharing] and :simple-googlemaps:{ .middle .google-blue } [Google Maps][google-maps-sharing], and potentially others. Check your preferred mapping app for this functionality.

## :fontawesome-regular-image: Photo sharing

Most phones support _shared photo albums_. Create the album, invite your fellow travelers, and each person can take photos and add them to the shared album.

You can do this in both :material-camera:{ .middle } [Apple Photos][apple-photo-sharing] and :simple-googlephotos:{ .middle .google-blue } [Google Photos][google-photo-sharing], and potentially others. Check your preferred photo management app for this functionality.

## :fontawesome-solid-plane-departure: Travel apps

Apps that keep track of flight/travel details can be useful. [Trip It], [Kayak], and apps like [Flighty] can be helpful, and will even send you push notifications about your flights.

??? note admonition "Subscription?"

    Most require a subscription for real-time data access and updates. Even if you don’t like app subscriptions, subscribing for the month of your trip could be worthwhile.
