# Embassies and Advisories

**Embassies** are places located in another country, but controlled by your country. If you have a major issue (e.g., lost/stolen passport) _while you are in that country_, you can visit your nation’s embassy in the country you’re visiting. Authorities from the visiting nation are not allowed into your nation’s embassy without clearance.

**Travel advisories** are statements issued by your country about visiting another country. Things to watch out for, be careful of, or sometimes instructions NOT to go in the first place (e.g., it is unwise to visit Russia during the current Russian invasion of Ukraine).
