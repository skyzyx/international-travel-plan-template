Understanding what you _have_ is important for understanding what you _need_.

#### Recommended power adapters

Some countries are not usually covered by universal adapters, such as **India** (Type D), **Israel** (Type H), and **South Africa** (Type M or N). You'll need to buy specific plug adapters for those destinations.

### 🕓 Understanding Time Zones

**UTC:** Coordinated Universal Time; formerly **GMT** = Greenwich Mean Time.

* Every time zone on earth is either positive or negative time from UTC.
* UTC never has daylight savings. Daylight savings changes the offsets from UTC.
* The line goes from North → South through London, England, UK.
* The opposite line on the other side of the world goes from North → South and is called the International Date Line. It runs though the Pacific Ocean.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time#/media/File:World_Time_Zones_Map.png>

In MONTH OF TRIP, LOCATION is on standard/daylight time, and/or does not observe daylight savings time:

> 👉 **AUTHOR’S NOTE:** This table uses Japan as an example destination, during months when the U.S. observes daylight savings time. Replace the information as appropriate.

### 🌎 Travel Products

> 👉 **AUTHOR’S NOTE:** These are things that _I_ travel with. If you have different recommendations, replace mine with yours.

**None of these are required**, but some of them will probably make your travel experience better.

There are cheaper options, but these are high quality and are likely to last. If you want them, plan to purchase them yourself.

### 👕 Doing Laundry in LOCATION

Are you packing light, and doing laundry during the trip?

* Does your hotel/hostel/Airbnb have a place to do laundry?
    * Washer AND dryer?
* What do they call a _landromat_ in LOCATION?
    * laundromat
    * coin laundry
* Do they air-dry clothes there? Or use a clothes dryer?
    * Eastern dryers aren’t always as powerful as Western dryers, and doing multiple cycles can add up.
    * Are _dryer sheets_ common in LOCATION?

### 📲 Apps to install

Browser websites:

* [Convert Currency1 → Currency2 to understand prices for things](https://currency.world).
* [Tokyo Wi-Fi locations](https://www.wifi-tokyo.jp).

### 📱SIM Cards for Mobile

> 👉 **AUTHOR’S NOTE:** This is what _I_ use for eSIM connectivity. Adjust this list as appropriate for your own needs.

eSIM is supported on [iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, or newer](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201296). iPhones 14 Plus/Pro/Max are _eSIM-only_ when sold in the US.

* Install [Airalo](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1475911720) app.
* LOCATION → 5GB data-only for 30 days (or whatever you want).
* “Green” SMS messages, and non-FaceTime calls to your NATIVE COUNTRY phone number will be expensive.
* “Blue” iMessages and FaceTime Audio/Video calls are cheap/free.

More information:

* [Use eSIM while traveling internationally with your iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213448)
* [Find wireless carriers and worldwide service providers that offer eSIM service](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209096)
* [Determine cellular bands supported by your iPhone](https://www.apple.com/iphone/cellular/)

We can save data usage and battery life by keeping our phones in “low power mode” while out and about during the day.

### 🪪 Wallet

Set up Apple Wallet (if you haven’t yet) AND KNOW HOW TO USE IT.

* [ ] Travel credit/debit cards.

Which side of the road do they drive on in your destination country? **Don't assume.** [Look it up](https://www.worldstandards.eu/cars/list-of-left-driving-countries/).

### 😷 COVID-19 Protocols

## Things to know about LOCATION

### ❌ Scams to Avoid!

1. [Big City] _Assume_ that people are trying to scam you.
2. If someone tries to start trouble, offer to let the police sort-out the situation, and look for an officer.

[Is there a YouTube video that explains things well for LOCATION?]

* 🚫 Once you leave the airport, NEVER EVER give anyone your Passport/ID. Not even if they are dressed like an officer/official.
* 🚫 Someone tries to push a CD into your hand.
* 🚫 Someone tries to put a bracelet on your arm (e.g., fake monk, visitor from another country).
* 🚫 Someone asks for donations (e.g., disaster relief, orphans, something else that makes you sad).
* 🚫 Someone asks for money to take a bus/train. Especially if it's a specific amount of money.
* 🚫 Someone bumps into you, drops something, then wants you to pay for it.
* 🚫 Guessing games on the street — Find the ball, pick the card, etc.
* 🚫 Bird Poop Scam — You think a bird pooped on you, but someone comes up to help clean you off. (Pick-pockets.)
* 🚫 Ask for prices of things up-front. Some businesses will overcharge you because you are a tourist, or will bring you a “tourist menu” with higher prices. I once got charged 20€ for _two donuts_.
* 🚫 Don’t take pictures of people dressed-up as characters — they will pressure you for money!
* 🚫 [Restaurant] Spiked drinks. Keep a close eye on your drinks.
* 🚫 [Airport] Someone asks if you need a taxi and takes you to a black car. (Use Uber/Lyft app instead.)
* 🚫 [Airport] Someone holds a sign that says “Uber”. (Use Uber/Lyft app instead.)
* 🚫 [Airport] If you use Uber/Lyft, make sure Name, License Plate, and Car Model all match what the app says.

### 🧠 Things to keep in-mind

[Is there a YouTube video that explains things well for LOCATION?]

* We’re going to be doing A LOT of walking. Bring comfortable shoes/clothes for walking MILES.
* Always go to the bathroom before you leave.
* Japan has bidets, which are uncommon in North America. Don’t be surprised!
* Japan has a strong culture of (a) following the rules, and (b) punctuality.
* Check the hourly forecast, and bring appropriate clothing.
* If you order from a busy place, PAY ATTENTION and don’t slow people down.
* If you need a little time to do something, move someplace out of the way.
* Pay attention to the direction of the train before getting on.
* Avoid street food vendors that don’t have many customers. (There’s probably a good reason for that.)
* If you engage/watch a street performer, make sure you tip (cash).
* There are dedicated bicycle lanes. Don’t walk in them. You will get hit.
* Be respectful of people’s time and get to the point. Plan your interactions accordingly.
* Notes about tipping culture?
