### 📱SIM Cards for Mobile

> 👉 **AUTHOR’S NOTE:** This is what _I_ use for eSIM connectivity. Adjust this list as appropriate for your own needs.

eSIM is supported on [iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, or newer](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201296). iPhones 14 Plus/Pro/Max are _eSIM-only_ when sold in the US.

* Install [Airalo](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1475911720) app.
* LOCATION → 5GB data-only for 30 days (or whatever you want).
* “Green” SMS messages, and non-FaceTime calls to your NATIVE COUNTRY phone number will be expensive.
* “Blue” iMessages and FaceTime Audio/Video calls are cheap/free.

More information:

* [Use eSIM while traveling internationally with your iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213448)
* [Find wireless carriers and worldwide service providers that offer eSIM service](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209096)
* [Determine cellular bands supported by your iPhone](https://www.apple.com/iphone/cellular/)

We can save data usage and battery life by keeping our phones in “low power mode” while out and about during the day.

## Things to know about LOCATION

### ❌ Scams to Avoid!

1. [Big City] _Assume_ that people are trying to scam you.
2. If someone tries to start trouble, offer to let the police sort-out the situation, and look for an officer.

[Is there a YouTube video that explains things well for LOCATION?]

* 🚫 Once you leave the airport, NEVER EVER give anyone your Passport/ID. Not even if they are dressed like an officer/official.
* 🚫 Someone tries to push a CD into your hand.
* 🚫 Someone tries to put a bracelet on your arm (e.g., fake monk, visitor from another country).
* 🚫 Someone asks for donations (e.g., disaster relief, orphans, something else that makes you sad).
* 🚫 Someone asks for money to take a bus/train. Especially if it's a specific amount of money.
* 🚫 Someone bumps into you, drops something, then wants you to pay for it.
* 🚫 Guessing games on the street — Find the ball, pick the card, etc.
* 🚫 Bird Poop Scam — You think a bird pooped on you, but someone comes up to help clean you off. (Pick-pockets.)
* 🚫 Ask for prices of things up-front. Some businesses will overcharge you because you are a tourist, or will bring you a “tourist menu” with higher prices. I once got charged 20€ for _two donuts_.
* 🚫 Don’t take pictures of people dressed-up as characters — they will pressure you for money!
* 🚫 [Restaurant] Spiked drinks. Keep a close eye on your drinks.
* 🚫 [Airport] Someone asks if you need a taxi and takes you to a black car. (Use Uber/Lyft app instead.)
* 🚫 [Airport] Someone holds a sign that says “Uber”. (Use Uber/Lyft app instead.)
* 🚫 [Airport] If you use Uber/Lyft, make sure Name, License Plate, and Car Model all match what the app says.

### 🧠 Things to keep in-mind

[Is there a YouTube video that explains things well for LOCATION?]

* We’re going to be doing A LOT of walking. Bring comfortable shoes/clothes for walking MILES.
* Always go to the bathroom before you leave.
* Japan has bidets, which are uncommon in North America. Don’t be surprised!
* Japan has a strong culture of (a) following the rules, and (b) punctuality.
* Check the hourly forecast, and bring appropriate clothing.
* If you order from a busy place, PAY ATTENTION and don’t slow people down.
* If you need a little time to do something, move someplace out of the way.
* Pay attention to the direction of the train before getting on.
* Avoid street food vendors that don’t have many customers. (There’s probably a good reason for that.)
* If you engage/watch a street performer, make sure you tip (cash).
* There are dedicated bicycle lanes. Don’t walk in them. You will get hit.
* Be respectful of people’s time and get to the point. Plan your interactions accordingly.
* Notes about tipping culture?
